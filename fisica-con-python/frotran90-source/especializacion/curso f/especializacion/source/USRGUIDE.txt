This file provides the information needed to use the f90gl libraries from
an application program.  It should be sufficient for most purposes, but is
not complete.  The definitive guide is the binding specification "A Fortran 90
Interface for OpenGL:  Revised January 1998", NISTIR 6134, which can be
obtained from the f90gl web page http://math.nist.gov/f90gl.

You may find the example programs and makefiles in f90gl/examples provide a
good guide to using f90gl.

Check the f90gl web page http://math.nist.gov/f90gl for the latest information,
makefiles for additional systems, etc.  Look under the list of Unix workstations
or list of Windows 95/NT systems for the status of systems that don't work at
the time of this release.  Look under Software for additional makefiles.  Look
under News for general announcements.

1) Using f90gl
   -----------

Program units that access entities (procedures, symbolic constants, etc.) from
OpenGL, GLU or GLUT must USE the appropriate module.  The modules are
OPENGL_GL, OPENGL_GLU and OPENGL_GLUT.

All OpenGL procedures and OpenGL "defined constants" are provided with the
same name as in the C interface, except that names are case insensitive and
names longer than 31 characters are truncated (there are a few of these in
the OpenGL extensions).  All procedure names are generic.  All defined
constants are integers with the PARAMETER attribute.

To insure correspondence between Fortran types and C types, you should always
specify the KIND type parameter for all actual arguments passed to OpenGL
procedures.
  - Variables should have the kind type parameter in the declaration.
  - Constants should have the kind type parameter attached (e.g., 1.0_GLFLOAT)
  - Expressions should evaluate to a value with the appropriate kind.
The correspondence between OpenGL types and Fortran TYPE(KIND) is
   GLbyte         INTEGER(GLBYTE)
   GLubyte        INTEGER(GLUBYTE)
   GLshort        INTEGER(GLSHORT)
   GLushort       INTEGER(GLUSHORT)
   GLint          INTEGER(GLINT)
   GLuint         INTEGER(GLUINT)
   GLenum         INTEGER(GLENUM)
   GLbitfield     INTEGER(GLBITFIELD)
   GLsizei        INTEGER(GLSIZEI)
   GLfloat        REAL(GLFLOAT)
   GLclampf       REAL(GLCLAMPF)
   GLdouble       REAL(GLDOUBLE)
   GLclampd       REAL(GLCLAMPD)
   GLboolean      LOGICAL(GLBOOLEAN)
   GLUquadricObj  TYPE(GLUQUADRICOBJ)
   GLUnurbsObj    TYPE(GLUNURBSOBJ)
   GLUtesselator  TYPE(GLUTESSELATOR)

For OpenGL procedures that return a character string (e.g. glGetString)
the Fortran result type is a pointer to an array of character(len=1).  You
can determine the length of the string with SIZE, and when you are done with
the string you can free the memory with DEALLOCATE.

TYPE(GLCPTR) is provided for storing C pointers.  GLNULLPTR and the == operator
are provided for testing against NULL.

gluNewNurbsRenderer, gluNewQuadric and gluNewTess return a pointer to the
appropriate derived type.  The C test for NULL "if (cptr == NULL)" is
achieved with ASSOCIATED: "IF (.NOT. ASSOCIATED(fptr))".

Procedures that take an argument of type GLvoid, which can be one of several
types, have a specific routine for each of the supported types plus
TYPE(GLCPTR), but are accessed through the generic name.

Some procedures in GLU and GLUT accept (in C) NULL as the actual argument for
a dummy function, to "turn off" a callback function.  From Fortran you can
pass GLUNULLFUNC or GLUTNULLFUNC.

In general, array arguments are assumed size arrays.  In some cases, the C
library will keep a pointer to the array for later processing.  In these
cases, the f90gl interface attaches the TARGET attribute to the dummy
argument.  It is the user's responsibility to insure that the actual argument
will persist and may be modified by a procedure to which it is not an argument.
One means of achieving this is to pass a whole array with the TARGET and SAVE
attributes.  The procedures and arguments to which this applies are:
 glFeedbackBuffer     buffer
 glSelectBuffer       buffer
 glEdgeFlagPointer    pointer
 glTexCoordPointer    pointer
 glColorPointer       pointer
 glIndexPointer       pointer
 glNormalPointer      pointer
 glVertexPointer      pointer
 gluNurbsCurve        uknot, ctlarray
 gluNurbsSurface      uknot, vknot, ctlarray
 gluPwlCurve          array
 gluTessVertex        data
 gluTessBeginPolygon  polygon_data
See f90gl/examples/glutdino.f90 for a complicated example.

To determine the proper command line to compile and link with the f90gl library,
see the makefile for your system in f90gl/examples.

2) Upgrading from f90gl version 1.0
   --------------------------------

f90gl version 1.0 implemented the original proposed Fortran 90 bindings for
OpenGL.  The final Fortran 90 bindings for OpenGL approved by the OpenGL ARB
and implemented in this version of f90gl contain non-upwardly-compatible
changes.  If you have application codes using the old bindings, they will have
to be changed to use this version of f90gl.

A utility is provided in f90gl/util/trans10 to help translate codes from
version 1.0.  Although it handles most cases, it does not do everything and
it may make unwanted changes.  So if you use this, BACK UP YOUR FILES FIRST!
trans10 is a sed script; read the file for instructions and limitations.

The changes that must be made to application programs are:

-- The module names have changed.  What was f90gl, f90glu and f90glut is now
   opengl_gl, opengl_glu and opengl_glut.

-- The f90 prefix on procedure names, kind type parameters and derived types
   has been removed.  All of these now have the same name as the C entities.
   If you used procedures with very names that were truncated, watch for a
   change in the truncation point.

-- glcptr changed from being a character length to a derived type.  What was
   character(glcptr) should now be type(glcptr)

-- glunull and glutnull should not be in an external statement anymore, and
   have been changed to glunullfunc and glutnullfunc

-- The GLUT fonts should not be in an external statement anymore.

-- Some arrays must persist after the call to the OpenGL routine that uses it
   (because OpenGL saves a pointer to it and uses it later).  However, what
   you did in f90gl 1.0 will probably still work, unless you used the trick of
   passing an array element as the actual argument, which is no longer
   supported.  It is now recommended that you only pass whole arrays in these
   cases, and that they have the TARGET and SAVE attributes.

3) Special system notes
   --------------------

All systems:
 - in gluTessBeginPolygon, polygon_data must be a rank one array of
   type integer(kind=glint) or real(kind=glfloat).
 - in gluTessVertex, vertexdata must be type(glcptr) or a rank one array of type
   integer(kind=glbyte, glshort or glint) or real(kind=glfloat or gldouble).
 - for the tesselator callback functions edgeFlag and edgeFlagData, the
   argument 'flag' is integer(kind=glint) instead of logical(kind=glboolean).
   A value of 0 corresponds to .false. and nonzero corresponds to .true.
 - in the callback function for glutKeyboardFunc, 'key' is returned as an
   integer(kind=glint) instead of a char.
 - in glutInit, argc and argv are optional.  If present, they must
   both be present, argc is an integer(kind=glcint) and argv is an
   array of character strings, one command line argument per
   array entry.  See f90gl/examples/olympic3.f90 for an example of sending
   command line arguments.
 - in callback functions for glu and glut, all arguments should be
   declared with intent(in out).
 - in the callback functions for gluTessCallback, any void * arguments
   must be an array of integer(kind=glint) or real(kind=glfloat), and
   when there is more than one such argument they must be the same type.
   The array arguments should be declared as assumed size, except with
   the F language where they are assumed shape.
 - some arrays are declared as assumed shape arrays in the f90gl modules
   instead of assumed size as specified in the bindings.  These are mostly
   integer(kind=glbyte) and integer(kind=glshort) arrays for which the size
   of the array is not known.  This should not make a difference to the user,
   but if it does you can find them in the fwrap*.fpp source files by searching
   for 'need assumed shape'.
 - glEdgeFlagPointer and glEdgeFlagPointerEXT require an argument that is a
   C pointer (address) of an array of one byte logicals.  Unfortunately
   Fortran 90 does not guarantee the existence of a one byte logical type, and
   logical(kind=glboolean) may or may not be this type.  The use of
   glEdgeFlagPointer will probably not work correctly unless
   logical(kind=glboolean) is a one byte logical.  An additional specific
   routine under the same generic name is provided which accepts ptr as
   integer(kind=glbyte).  If your system supports one byte integers (most do),
   then this form can be used using 1 for .true. and 0 for .false.

NASoftware, Linux:
 - arrays that will have their addresses saved in the C library do not
   have the target attribute as specified in the binding.
 - you must have the directory containing the libraries
   (e.g. <path-to-f90gl>/f90gl/lib) in your LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

F:
 - currently does not work with F because of size limitations in the F
   compilers.  Check the f90gl web page for the latest information.
 - the remaining comments are likely to apply if f90gl supports F in the future.
 - glAreTexturesResident and glAreTexturesResidentEXT
   These are subroutines instead of functions.  They take an additional
   intent(out) logical(kind=glboolean) argument, areresident, at the end of the
   argument list to return the function result.
 - gluProject, gluUnProject and gluScaleImage
   These are subroutines instead of functions.  They take an additional
   intent(out) integer(kind=glint) argument, errcode, at the end of the argument
   list to return the function result.
 - glutCreateMenu is a subroutine instead of a function.  It takes an additional
   intent(out) integer(king=glint) argument, menuid, at the end of the argument
   list to return the function result.
 - arrays are declared as assumed shape arrays in the f90gl modules instead of
   assumed size as specified in the bindings.  This should not matter.
 - in the vertex array extension, the named constant
   GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY_POINTER_EXT is renamed
   GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY_POINTERX instead of truncating to the 31 characters
   GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY_POINTER_ because F doesn't allow a name to end with _
 - instead of passing glunullfunc and glutnullfunc as NULL for a procedure
   actual argument, omit the argument.  For example, to disable the IdleFunc
   use 'call glutidlefunc()' instead of 'call glutidlefunc(glutnullfunc)'.
 - in gluTessCallback, if the void * arguments to the callback function
   are integer arrays, then the value for 'which' must have _INT appended
   to it, for example GLU_TESS_VERTEX_INT.
 - the combine and combineData callbacks in gluTessCallback will not work
   because they require passing arrays from C to F and C does not know
   about assumed shape arrays.
 - capitalization is important in F.  All f90gl procedure names, kind type
   parameters and defined types must be lower case, and all "defined constants",
   GLUNULLFUNC and GLUTNULLFUNC must be upper case.

Educational F on Linux:
 - Everything listed under F above applies to Educational F, too.
 - The following routines are not supported except for the argument ptr
   being of type(glcptr): glColorPointer, glIndexPointer, glNormalPointer,
   glTexCoordPointer, glVertexPointer, glVertexPointerEXT, glNormalPointerEXT,
   glColorPointerEXT, glIndexPointerEXT, glTexCoordPointerEXT.
 - The following routines are not supported at all:  glFeedbackBuffer,
   glSelectBuffer, glEdgeFlagPointer, glEdgeFlagPointerEXT gluNurbsCurve,
   gluNurbsSurface and gluPwlCurve.

XLF:
 - If f90gl was built with OLDXLF defined in the preprocessor file (XLF versions
   older than 3.2.5.2 and 4.1.0.1) then arrays that OpenGL keeps a pointer to
   may not work correctly.  Try the glutdino example.  If the dinosaur has
   sides, then it is OK.

Lahey:
 - Lahey provides a binary version of f90gl that works with LF90, LF95 and
   ELF90.  Go to http://www.lahey.com and search for OpenGL.
   The remaining comments pertain to building f90gl from the sources instead
   of using the precompiled libraries.
 - Note that for Lahey/Fujitsu LF95 the mf key uses "j" for Fujitsu.
 - You must use LF95 if you use MS VC++.  With the Borland C compiler you
   can use either LF90 or LF95.

DVF
 - Compaq (Digital) supplies a binary version of f90gl for DVF.  Go to
   http://www.compaq.com/fortran and look under "Downloads".

Salford:
 - does not work with Salford ftn95.  Check the f90gl web page for the
   latest information.

Digital Fortran on Digital Unix:
 - If f90gl was compiled with #define DIGITAL_NO_ECO_02 in fppincs/fppaddo
   because patch ECO 02 has not been applied to the Digital Fortran compiler,
   then there is a slight change in the API as follows:
       in gluTessCallback, if the void * arguments to the callback function
       are integer arrays, then the value for 'which' must have _INT appended
       to it, for example GLU_TESS_VERTEX_INT.
   If you get a compile time error about not matching the generic interface
   for gluTessCallback, change whether or not _INT is appended to the symbolic
   value for 'which'.
