1) GLUT
   ----

You need version 3.7 or later of GLUT.  Build GLUT as per the usual
instructions in the GLUT distribution, but be certain to copy both glut.h
and glutf90.h, to an include/GL directory.

At the time of this release of f90gl, GLUT 3.7 was still in beta test.
Earlier 3.7 beta versions will not work with f90gl.  To be certain that
you have the correct version of GLUT, you should obtain GLUT from the
f90gl web page http://math.nist.gov/f90gl until the official release of
GLUT 3.7.  It is available in .tar.gz and .zip formats, and precompiled
for Windows.

The GLUT home page is http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/glut3/glut3.html

2) system code
   -----------

Makefiles are provided for all systems on which f90gl has been tested.  To keep
the names within the 8.3 naming convention, a 4 (or 5) character code is
assigned to each system configuration.  These characters designate the
hardware, operating system, Fortran compiler, OpenGL and (optionally) special
designations.  For example, s4nm is the code for a Sun workstation with
SunOS 4.x, the NAGware compiler, and Mesa.  Look in the file mf_keys to
determine the code for your system.

If you do not find a preprocessor file and makefiles for your system, you
should find a similar system and make your own files using the files for
that system as a starting point.  If you have success with a new system and
would like to share your makefiles and preproccessor file with other users,
send email to william.mitchell@nist.gov.

3) fpp preprocessor file
   ---------------------

f90gl uses a simple preprocessor for conditional compilations to handle
differences in the OpenGL version, supported extensions, ways that Fortran
and C interface, limitations in the subset languages, and compiler bugs.

The directory f90gl/fppincs contains files of definitions for the preprocessor
for each system.  The names of these files are of the form fppxxxx where xxxx
is the system code described above.  There is also a file fppnada which is
used by systems that do not need any information in this file.

As of version 1.2.6, the remainder of this section is relevant only
to MS Windows systems, except for the last paragraph.

Identify the fpp file for your system, or create one from the file for a
similar system.  Then verify that the #define statements are correct for
your system.  There are three sets of these: OpenGL version, extensions, and
special system designations.

You must first identify the OpenGL version and extensions supported by your
OpenGL library.  To do this, look at the file ???/include/GL/gl.h.

To determine your OpenGL version, look for the string VERSION.  There
should be a few of them of the form GL_VERSION_1_1, GL_VERSION_1_2,
etc.  These tell you what version is supported.

The fpp file should have a #define for each version number up to your version
of OpenGL.  For example, if you have OpenGL 1.1 then the fpp file should have
#define OPENGL_1_0
#define OPENGL_1_1
!#define OPENGL_1_2
Note that the last one is commented out.

To determine which extensions are supported by your OpenGL, search for GL_EXT
in gl.h.  You should find the list of supported extensions, e.g.
/* Extensions */
#define GL_EXT_abgr                       1
#define GL_EXT_blend_color                1

The fpp file has a #define statement for each extension currently supported by
f90gl.  You should comment out any that are not supported by your OpenGL.
If you don't comment out one that is not supported, you will get undefined
symbol errors from the linker.  If you do comment out one that is supported,
you will not be able to use that extension from Fortran.  If your favorite
extension is not listed in the fpp file, it is not currently supported by
f90gl; send email to william.mitchell@nist.gov and we'll consider adding it
to the next release.

The final set of #define statements indicate system configuration details,
usually indicating what compiler is being used.  These are only necessary
when the f90gl source code needs to do something special for this sytem,
for example work around a compiler bug.  You should probably leave these
alone, and for a new system not define any.  An exception is GLU_1_1_TESS
which should be defined if and only if the OpenGL library does not support
GLU 1.2 tesselation.  Look for GLU_VERSION_1_2 in .../include/GL/glu.h.

4) makefile
   --------

The makefile names begin with mf.  In the top directory there is a file for
each system on which f90gl has been tested of the form mfxxxx (for makefiles) or
mfxxxx.bat (for DOS batch files) where xxxx is the system code.

Identify your makefile and edit it to set the directories in which your
system keeps the OpenGL and X11 include files.  If your system is not supported,
then find a similar system and use it as a starting point for your makefile.
You will probably have to change some additional macros at the beginning of
the makefile.

The subdirectories util, gl, glu and glut contain makefiles that are called
by the top level makefile.  Some of these are common to many systems (e.g.
mfmost for most systems), and some are system specific using the name mfxxxx
where xxxx is the system code.  You should not have to make any changes to these
makefiles.

The subdirectory examples contains a makefile for each system on which f90gl
has been tested.  This will need to be edited to for your system similar to
the top level makefile.

5) compile and install
   -------------------

If xxxx is your system code, then from the top f90gl directory:

at a Unix prompt, type make -f mfxxxx
at a DOS  prompt, type mfxxxx
exception: for the PGI compiler on Windows, use make

This will compile the f90gl libraries, move them to f90gl/lib, and move
any "module" files to either f90gl/include/GL or f90gl/lib, depending on
the system.  After testing, you can either leave them there or move them
to another home, for example the lib and include directories containing
OpenGL.

"make -f mfxxxx clean" (in Unix) or "mfxxxx clean" (in DOS) will delete all
files generated by the building process, but leave the library and module
files in f90gl/include/GL and f90gl/lib.

"make -f mfxxxx reallyclean" or "mfxxxx reallyclean" will delete the files
in f90gl/include and f90gl/lib, too.

6) test
   ----

Finally you should test the libraries by building and running the example
programs in f90gl/examples.  See the README file in that directory.

7) system specific notes
   ---------------------

all systems

 - no notes

NASoftware/Linux

 - you must use FortranPlus Version 2.0.5 or later.
 - you must have the directory containing the libraries
   (e.g. <path-to-f90gl>/f90gl/lib) in your LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
   to build the examples

NASoftware/WinNT

 - you must use FortranPlus Version 2.0.55 or later

Lahey

 - Lahey supplies a binary version of f90gl that works with LF90, LF95, and
   ELF90.  Go to http://www.lahey.com/ and search for OpenGL.

   The remaining comments pertain to building f90gl from the sources instead
   of using the precompiled libraries.

 - Note that for Lahey/Fujitsu LF95 on Windows the mf key uses "j" for Fujitsu.

 - you must use LF95 if you use MS VC++.  With the Borland C compiler you can
   use either LF90 or LF95.

 - with LF95 5.5 or later and MS VC++, you may find multiple definitions of
   WinMain when you link an example.  If so, comment out the line that
   creates winmain.obj in f90gl/gl/mf8njo

DVF

 - Compaq (Digital) supplies a binary version of f90gl for DVF.  Go to
   http://www.compaq.com/fortran and look under "Downloads".

Salford

 - does not currently work with Salford ftn95.  Check the f90gl web page for 
   the latest information.

XLF

 - XLF versions before 3.2.5.2 and 4.1.0.1 do not allow the target attribute
   on assumed size arrays in both fwrap.fpp and interf.fpp.  If you get a
   compile time error message related to this, then add "#define OLDXLF" to the
   end of the fpp file in f90gl/fppincs.  Note that if you do this then arrays
   for which C keeps a pointer and uses the array later may not work properly
   (for example, the glutdino example will not draw the sides of the dino).

F

 - currently does not work with F because of size limitations in the F
   compilers.  Check the f90gl web page for the latest information.

Digital Fortran on Digital Unix

 - with Digital Fortran 90 V4.1 you need to apply a patch to the compiler.
   Without it you will get an error message about no matching specific
   routine for the generic subroutine gluTessCallback when you compile the
   glutdino example.
   You can either:
   -- Download ECO 02 for DIGITAL Fortran for DIGITAL UNIX from
      http://www.digital.com/fortran/downloads.html
      and patch the compiler before building f90gl, or
   -- add #define DIGITAL_NO_ECO_02 to the fpp file, but this is a hack
      that changes the API for gluTessCallback (see USRGUIDE).  I only
      recommend this for someone who does not have root privileges (so
      can't patch the compiler) and can't get the sysadmin to patch it
      right away.  You should reinstall f90gl without the hack once you
      finally do get the sysadmin to patch the compiler.

PACIFIC SIERRA

 - currently does not work with the Pacific Sierra compiler on Linux.  Check
   the f90gl web page for the latest information.
